      <p>Politicize My Death is a platform for those who want their preventable death to be used to advocate for change. We understand that when someone is killed by a motorist, dies from gun violence, or lack of access to safe abortions, it's not just a personal tragedy â€“ it's also a failure of society to protect its people.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, some people may argue that using a person's death to promote change is inappropriate or disrespectful to the deceased. At Politicize My Death, we believe that many people who die from preventable causes would want their death to have meaning, to prevent others from experiencing the same fate.</p>
      <p>That's why we invite you to take the pledge and let everyone know that it's okay to use your story if you die from a preventable cause. By taking this pledge, you can help others understand the importance of promoting change and advocating for a safer society.</p>
      <p>We believe that your death should not be in vain, and that your story can inspire meaningful change. So join us in pledging to make a difference, even in death.</p>
